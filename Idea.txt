IDEA

User Registration/Login:
-secure system 
-allowing users to create accounts
-log in using credentials

Personal Limits Setting:
-Users can set personal limits on the amount of money, time, or frequency they want to spend on betting
-Ex. 1000 dollars, 1 week, every 2 days
-mobile: requires access to screen time
-computer: various strategies such as browser extensions that restrict access to gambling websites or software that limits time spent on specific sites

Activity Tracking: 
-The app can track user activity within the platform
-keeps a record of bets placed or gambling sessions

(MAYBE) Notifications and Alerts: 
-Provides timely reminders when users approach or exceed their set limits
-reminders help them stay in control

Resources and Support: 
-similar to the tobacco app
-offers access to resources, helplines, or support networks for individuals dealing with gambling addiction
-talks ab gambling safely

Data Analysis and Reporting: 
-gives users insights into their betting patterns and habits 
-helps them make informed decisions about their gambling behavior

what information do we want to store from the user?
user profile consists of many things (ex. social media has username, name itself, description, caption, etc.)
what do we want to keep track of?
